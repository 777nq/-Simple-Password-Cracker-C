Usage:

Compile the C++ code using a C++ compiler (e.g., g++).
Run the compiled program.
Enter a password that you want the program to attempt to crack.
The program will generate random passwords until it successfully cracks the entered password.
Please note that this is a very basic and educational simulation of a password cracker. In practice, password cracking is illegal and unethical without proper authorization.

Disclaimer: Always use your programming skills responsibly and within the bounds of the law and ethical standards. Unauthorized attempts to crack passwords or gain unauthorized access to systems are illegal and unethical. This project is purely for educational purposes and should not be used for any malicious activities.
